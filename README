TextileConverter
----------------

These classes are my own implementation of a Textile engine, but agremented for my own needs.

Synthaxe of command are a little bit modified to add features.

All mechanism is developped into the Textile class (Textile.class.php).
Tags would be extendable (soon) with TextilePlugin class and ITextilePlugin interface.

I am trying to keep classes well documented with clear explanation and some sample when needed.

For any comment or idea, or bug, don't hesitate to contact me :

have fun.
